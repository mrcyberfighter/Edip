/** libedip:
  *
  *  Was developed by Eddie Br√ºggemann <mrcyberfighter@gmail.com> for his **Easy Digital Imaging Processing** program called @Edip.
  *
  *  This library is based on the @OpenCV library opencv-3.0.0 (the latest release) provided with this file as support (for GTK+3 compatibility reason).  
  *
  *  The @OpenCV library provide over 300 algorithms for computer vision purpose.
  *
  *  The @OpenCV libary was introduced in 1999 and adopted as primary development tool for computer vision by
  *  researcher and developers in computer vision.
  *  @OpenCV was originally developed at Intel by a team lead by Gary Bradsky as an initiative to advanced resaerch in vision and
  *  promote the development of rich vision, CPU-intensiv applications.
  *
  *  1. 2006 first major release of @OpenCV.
  *  2. 2009 second major release of @OpenCV.
  *  3. 2012 reshape from @OpenCV to a non-profit foundation <http://opencv.org>
  *
  *  Thank's to all the contributors of the @OpenCV libary for providing us this exceptional tool.
